## üìù Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports
- Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- Include reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details
- Provide sample data if possible (anonymized)

### Feature Requests
- Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
- Explain the use case and expected behavior
- Consider if the feature aligns with the project's scope

### Code Contributions
- **Small fixes:** Direct PRs are welcome
- **Larger features:** Open an issue first to discuss the approach
- **Documentation:** Always welcome improvements to README, docstrings, or examples

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings for new functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and testable

### Commit Style
Use conventional commits where possible:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `perf:` Performance improvements

### Testing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass: `pytest -q`
- Test with sample data from the `demo/` directory
- Consider edge cases and error conditions

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you change functionality
2. **Add tests** for new features
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
4. **Ensure all tests pass**
5. **Request review** from maintainers

### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Performance improvement
- [ ] Refactoring

```

## üß™ Testing with Sample Data

The repository includes sample data in the `demo/` directory:
- `sample_2x_codes.csv` - Small test dataset
- `sample_2x_codes_large.csv` - Larger test dataset
- `sample_2x_codes.json` - JSON format examples

Test your changes with:
```bash
# Test with small dataset
iab-mapper demo/sample_2x_codes.csv -o test_output.json

# Test with larger dataset
iab-mapper demo/sample_2x_codes_large.csv -o test_output_large.json
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

- The mapper processes data locally, so performance matters
- Consider memory usage with large datasets
- Embeddings can be memory-intensive - test with realistic data sizes
- Profile changes that might affect processing speed

## üîí Security & Privacy

- This tool processes data locally - no external APIs by default
- Be mindful of any changes that might introduce external dependencies
- Ensure PII handling remains local-only
- Test offline functionality

## üìû Getting Help

- **Issues:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mixpeek/iab-mapper/issues)
- **Discussions:** Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- **Documentation:** Check the [README](README.md) and inline docs

## üéØ Project Goals

The IAB Mapper aims to:
- Simplify IAB 2.x ‚Üí 3.0 migration for the industry
- Provide reliable, auditable mapping results
- Support local-first processing for privacy
- Enable extensibility through custom synonyms and overrides

When contributing, keep these goals in mind and consider how your changes support the broader industry adoption of IAB 3.0.
